# MirceaD-Strava-Analyzer---Code-in-Place-2025
A Python program that calculates stats for a list of Strava activities, specifically running and cycling


I created a straightforward program to analyse my running and cycling activities in Strava. I've been running since 2014 and commuting to work since 2022, but I had never taken a detailed look at my stats. Therefore, I created this tool that spits out various statistics. 

The program provides detailed statistics, such as total distance, average speed, and personal records, along with insights into weekly and monthly activity patterns, time-of-day preferences, and gear usage. 

The user interacts with a menu to select specific analyses or run all at once, receiving clear summary reports and simple text-based visualisations to help uncover trends and highlights in their workout history.

Thank you!
